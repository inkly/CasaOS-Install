# Assemble a CasaOS-Install release from components that have already been
# released by their own repositories.
#
# Nothing is compiled here. Each Go service publishes its own tarballs and a
# checksums.txt from its own release workflow; this script fetches those
# checksums and writes them into install.sh, so the digests the installer
# verifies against are never typed by hand. Two consecutive releases once
# existed only to fix a mistyped digest - that is the failure this removes.
# The dashboard's release and IceWhale's App Store release publish none; those
# two digests are computed here from the tarball as published (see
# compute_checksum).
#
# The App Store seed is the one asset still fetched from IceWhale, and only at
# release time: it is the snapshot the installer needs for a new box to come up
# with a populated store. It is mirrored into OUTPUT_DIR, published as an asset
# of our own release, and pinned by the digest of the copy we publish, so a new
# install no longer depends on IceWhale's release still existing. This changes
# nothing about who curates the catalogue: AppManagement keeps polling
# IceWhale's live store feed at run time.
#
# What it produces, in OUTPUT_DIR:
#   install.sh            the installer with every tag and digest filled in
#   casaos-uninstall      the uninstaller, served from our release rather than
#                         from a third party's web server; its digest is
#                         written into install.sh like the packages'
#   linux-all-appstore-<tag>.tar.gz
#                         IceWhale's App Store seed as published, mirrored so a
#                         new install does not depend on their release
#   linux-zz-casaos-compat-overlay-<tag>.tar.gz
#                         the setup scripts of the six components, plus the
#                         release marker read by the in-app updater
#   version.json          what the in-app updater polls: the tag and the
#                         CHANGELOG.md section of this release
#   release-notes.md      that same section, the body of the GitHub release
#   components.lock       the exact commits and tags this release was cut from
#   checksums.txt         digests of everything above
#
# Inputs:
#   release/components.env   tags and commits of every component
#   WORKSPACE_ROOT           directory holding the six component checkouts,
#                            each at the commit pinned in components.env
#                            (default: the parent of this repository)
#   GITHUB_OWNER             account the component releases live under
#                            (default: inkly)
#   CHECKSUMS_BASE_URL       where to fetch <repo>/releases/download/<tag>/checksums.txt
#                            of the six Go services, and the dashboard tarball,
